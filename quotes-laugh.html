<p>Don't let idiots ruin your day.</p>
<p>Why be moody when you can shake yo booty.</p>
<p>Never do the same mistake twice. Unless he's hot!</p>
<p>Be like the sun keep on shining and let them burn.</p>
<p>An apple a day keeps anyone away if you trow it hard enough.</p>
<p>
  whatever you must do today... Do it with the confidence of a 4-year old in a
  batman cape.
</p>
<p>If life give you lemons... add Vodka.</p>
<p>
  When life shuts a door... open it again. It's a door. That's how they work.
</p>
<p>
  Knowledge is knowing a tomato is a fruit. Wisdom is not putting it in a fruit
  salad.
</p>
<p>Life is short. Smile while you still have teeth.</p>
<p>After Tuesday, even the calender goes W T F</p>
<p>
  When something goes wrong in your life, just yell, "PLOT TWIST!" and move on.
