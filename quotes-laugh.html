      <p>Don't let idiots ruin your day.</p>
      <p>Why be moody when you can shake yo booty.</p>
      <p>Never do the same mistake twice. Unless he's hot!</p>
      <p>Be like the sun keep on shining and let them burn.</p>
      <p>An apple a day keeps anyone away if you trow it hard enough.</p>
      <p>
        whatever you must do today... Do it with the confidence of a 4-year old
        in a batman cape.
      </p>
      <p>If life give you lemons... add Vodka.</p>
      <p>
        When life shuts a door... open it again. It's a door. That's how they
        work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Knowledge is knowing a tomato is a fruit. Wisdom is not putting it in a
        fruit salad.
      </p>
      <p>Life is short. Smile while you still have teeth.</p>
      <p>After Tuesday, even the calender goes W T F</p>
      <p>
        When something goes wrong in your life, just yell, "PLOT TWIST!" and
        move on.
