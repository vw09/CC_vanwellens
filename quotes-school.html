        Slow progress is better than no progress. Stay positive and never giv
        up.

      <p>
        The capacity to learn is a gift; the abilty to learn is a skill; the
        willing to learn is a choice
      </p>

        Succes is ni accident. Its hard work, perseverance, learning,
        studying,sacrifice and teh most of all, love of what you are doing or
        learning to do.

      <p>
        Your mindset is everyting. It shapes your world and your reality, choose
        wisely!
      </p>
      <p>
        Succes does not lie in the "results" buut in "efforts", "being" the best
        is nit so important, "doing" the best is al that matters...
      </p>
      <p>If the plan doesn't work, change the plan but never the goal.</p>
      <p>Focus on the step in front of you, not the whole staircase.</p>
      <p>Your direction is more important than your speed.</p>
      <p>Don't stop until you're proud.</p>
      <p>A negative mind will never give you a positive life.</p>
