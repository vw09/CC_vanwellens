<p>Slow progress is better than no progress. Stay positive and never giv up.</p>
<p>
  The capacity to learn is a gift; the abilty to learn is a skill; the willing
  to learn is a choice
</p>
<p>
  Succes is ni accident. Its hard work, perseverance, learning,
  studying,sacrifice and teh most of all, love of what you are doing or learning
  to do.
</p>
<p>
  Your mindset is everyting. It shapes your world and your reality, choose
  wisely!
</p>
<p>
  Succes does not lie in the "results" buut in "efforts", "being" the best is
  nit so important, "doing" the best is al that matters...
</p>
<p>If the plan doesn't work, change the plan but never the goal.</p>
<p>Focus on the step in front of you, not the whole staircase.</p>
<p>Your direction is more important than your speed.</p>
<p>Don't stop until you're proud.</p>
<p>A negative mind will never give you a positive life.</p>
