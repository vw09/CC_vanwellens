      <p>Don't let idiots ruin your day.</p>
      <p>Why be moody when you can shake yo booty.</p>
      <p>Never do the same mistake twice. Unless he's hot!</p>
      <p>Be like the sun keep on shining and let them burn.</p>
      <p>An apple a day keeps anyone away if you trow it hard enough.</p>
      <p>
        whatever you must do today... Do it with the confidence of a 4-year old
        in a batman cape.
      </p>
      <p>If life give you lemons... add Vodka.</p>
      <p>
        When life shuts a door... open it again. It's a door. That's how they
        work.

        Knowledge is knowing a tomato is a fruit. Wisdom is not putting it in a
        fruit salad.

      <p>Life is short. Smile while you still have teeth.</p>
      <p>After Tuesday, even the calender goes W T F</p>
      <p>
        When something goes wrong in your life, just yell, "PLOT TWIST!" and
        move on.

        Slow progress is better than no progress. Stay positive and never giv
        up.

        The capacity to learn is a gift; the abilty to learn is a skill; the
        willing to learn is a choice
      </p>

        Succes is ni accident. Its hard work, perseverance, learning,
        studying,sacrifice and teh most of all, love of what you are doing or
        learning to do.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your mindset is everyting. It shapes your world and your reality, choose
        wisely!
      </p>
      <p>
        Succes does not lie in the "results" buut in "efforts", "being" the best
        is nit so important, "doing" the best is al that matters...
      </p>
      <p>If the plan doesn't work, change the plan but never the goal.</p>
      <p>Focus on the step in front of you, not the whole staircase.</p>
      <p>Your direction is more important than your speed.</p>
      <p>Don't stop until you're proud.</p>
      <p>A negative mind will never give you a positive life.</p>

      <p>You carry so mutch love in your heart. Give some to yourself.</p>
      <p>You have always been enough!</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>You owe it to youreself to become everything you were born with.</p>
      <p>Don't let insecurity ruin the beauty you were born with.</p>
      <p>You are magic, own that shit!</p>
      <p>Life is too short to spend it at war with your self.</p>
      <p>Is not selfish to make your happines your main priority.</p>
      <p>
        Your commitment to being authentic has to be greater than your desire to
        approvel.
      </p>
      <p>
        Don't compare your life to others. There's no comparison between the sun
        and the moon they shine when it's their time.
      </p>
      <p>Your life isn't yours if you always care what others think</p>
      <p>
        If you focus in the hurt, you will continue to suffer. If you focus on
        the lesson, you will continue to grow.
      </p>
      <p>
        Reminder: You can be a good person with a kind heart and still tell
        people to fuck off when needed.
      </p>
      <p>
        To the world, you may be one person, but to one persone you may be the
        world.
