<p>You carry so mutch love in your heart. Give some to yourself.</p>
<p>You have always been enough!</p>
<p></p>
<p>You owe it to youreself to become everything you were born with.</p>
<p>Don't let insecurity ruin the beauty you were born with.</p>
<p>You are magic, own that shit!</p>
<p>Life is too short to spend it at war with your self.</p>
<p>Is not selfish to make your happines your main priority.</p>
<p>
  Your commitment to being authentic has to be greater than your desire to
  approvel.
</p>
<p>
  Don't compare your life to others. There's no comparison between the sun and
  the moon they shine when it's their time.
</p>
<p>Your life isn't yours if you always care what others think</p>
<p>
  If you focus in the hurt, you will continue to suffer. If you focus on the
  lesson, you will continue to grow.
</p>
<p>
  Reminder: You can be a good person with a kind heart and still tell people to
  fuck off when needed.
</p>
<p>
  To the world, you may be one person, but to one persone you may be the world.
