      <p>You carry so mutch love in your heart. Give some to yourself.</p>
      <p>You have always been enough!</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>You owe it to youreself to become everything you were born with.</p>
      <p>Don't let insecurity ruin the beauty you were born with.</p>
      <p>You are magic, own that shit!</p>
      <p>Life is too short to spend it at war with your self.</p>
      <p>Is not selfish to make your happines your main priority.</p>
      <p>
        Your commitment to being authentic has to be greater than your desire to
        approvel.
      </p>
      <p>
        Don't compare your life to others. There's no comparison between the sun
        and the moon they shine when it's their time.
      </p>
      <p>Your life isn't yours if you always care what others think</p>
      <p>
        If you focus in the hurt, you will continue to suffer. If you focus on
        the lesson, you will continue to grow.
      </p>
      <p>
        Reminder: You can be a good person with a kind heart and still tell
        people to fuck off when needed.
      </p>
      <p>
        To the world, you may be one person, but to one persone you may be the
        world.
